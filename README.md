# basicPerceptron
1.This is a simple binary perceptron, it reads in the data from seperate test and train .txt files where there are three classes which have no meaning   

2.Two specified classes in the function calls are used to train and then test the algorithm   

3.To test for un-comment the three lines with call the binary function near the bottom of the file: 
binary(1, 2) 
binary(2, 3) 
binary(1, 3) 
the arguments are the numbers which refer to the class label in the data, eg binary(1,2) will discriminate between class 1 and 2, ignoring the data for class 3 and so on
